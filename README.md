### What is Air Quality Index ?

The Air Quality Index is a scale designed to convey the current state of air quality to people in easily comprehensible terms. It converts the complex air quality data of different pollutants into a numerical value (index value), terminology and colour. The main objective of the AQI is to inform and caution the public about the risk of exposure to daily pollution levels.
